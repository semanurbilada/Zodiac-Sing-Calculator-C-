# Zodiac-Sing-Calculator-C-

That’s a project for zodiac sign calculator. I have not much idea about zodiacs so that’s a project for me, too. 

But, mostly I want to do a Xcode project with C, and show how to write C in a Mac. Because this was a problem for me, writing C/C++ in a Mac. I hope this could be helpful for someone else that has a problem like me. 

And, of course you can add rising sign and things like that for the zodiac sign calculator.
